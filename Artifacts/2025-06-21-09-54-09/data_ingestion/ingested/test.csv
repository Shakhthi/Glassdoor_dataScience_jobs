About Sitetracker
Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.

About Us
When Petpooja’s first avatar came into being in 2011, it was a simple B2B food delivery model that took bulk food orders from the corporates & passed them forward to the restaurants. But soon, our founders realised that the restaurants they worked with were not living up to their potential and were shutting down forever. Primarily it was due to a lack of coherent technology that could support their daily operations. Their billing machines were as bulky, tedious and old as time. Due to this, the restaurants never had an actual estimate of their profit margins & expenses. Back then, restaurants were suffering more than growing.

This was when our founders decided to build a robust, user-friendly & cost-effective billing software for SMB restaurants that will automate everyday operations and push businesses towards sustainability.

And now, a decade into the industry, we have realized our dream of becoming the ideal restaurant billing solution provider to all & every kind of food service business in India.
